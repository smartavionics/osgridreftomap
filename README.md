osgridreftomap
==============

Simple web page to convert an OS grid reference to WGS84 coordinates and display
the location using google maps.

You can try it out [here](http://smartavionics.github.com/osgridreftomap/osgridreftomap.html).

Most of the work is done by 3rd party javascript so many thanks to the authors of that code.
